# Cat breeds search
This repo is a small showcase of my current expertise in working with typescript and react based projects 

## Business logic
- API list fetch
- UI pagination
- UI sort
- UI search

## Libraries and tools used
- Create React App *(custom webpack config not always a best thing)*
- Typescript
- MaterialUI
- React query *(for api state management)*
- Axios
- React Testing Library :heart:
- Msw *(for API integration testing)*
- Prettier
- Multiple eslint plugins
- Yarn v2

## React patterns used
- HOC for deferring data rendering while data is fetching or on error
- Hooks for stateful business logic decoupling
- Atomic design
- Mockless component testing for confidence


## Commands
- `yarn start` development env
- `yarn build` production package
- `yarn test` unit testing
- `yarn lint` linting
- `yarn typecheck` typescript type checking
